## Event Tracker Project : Nutrition Tracker

The Event Tracker Project is intended to create anything that keeps information over time which in this case is someones nutritional value intake.  This project is our week 11 homework and is getting more work in using the REST architecture functionalities to build a full stack application.  The application will further be built on as we go into JavaScript to build the front end as well as working on more tables to include trackers for individual fluctuations while tracking their diet.
